      <h2>Smart Contract Security</h2>
      <p>
        Security is our top priority at LIESOL. Our smart contracts undergo rigorous security measures:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Regular third-party security audits by leading blockchain security firms</li>
        <li>Comprehensive testing and validation before any deployment</li>
        <li>Open-source code for community review and verification</li>
        <li>Bug bounty program to incentivize responsible disclosure</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Validator Selection</h2>
      <p>
        We maintain strict criteria for validator selection to ensure the safety of staked assets:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Proven track record of reliability and performance</li>
        <li>High uptime requirements (99.9%+)</li>
        <li>Regular monitoring and performance evaluation</li>
        <li>Geographically distributed to enhance network resilience</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Risk Management</h2>
      <p>
        Our risk management strategy includes:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Stake distribution across multiple validators to minimize risk</li>
        <li>Real-time monitoring of validator performance</li>
        <li>Automated systems to detect and respond to potential issues</li>
        <li>Emergency procedures for unexpected situations</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Insurance Coverage</h2>
      <p>
        While staking inherently carries some risk, we implement multiple layers of protection:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Smart contract coverage for potential vulnerabilities</li>
        <li>Validator slashing protection</li>
        <li>Emergency withdrawal procedures</li>
        <li>Continuous monitoring and risk assessment</li>
      </ul>
