      <h1>Staking Process</h1>
      
      <h2>How to Stake</h2>
      <p>
        Our liquid staking process is designed to be simple and user-friendly. Follow these steps to start earning rewards:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Connect your Solana wallet to the LIESOL platform</li>
        <li>Choose the amount of SOL you want to stake</li>
        <li>Review and approve the transaction</li>
        <li>Receive LSOL tokens representing your staked SOL</li>
        <li>Start earning staking rewards automatically</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Unstaking Options</h2>
      <p>
        We offer two methods to unstake your SOL:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Instant Unstake:</strong> Convert your LSOL back to SOL immediately using our liquidity pools 
          (a small fee applies to cover the instant liquidity provision)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Standard Unstake:</strong> Redeem your LSOL for SOL through the normal unstaking process, 
          which takes 2-3 epochs (approximately 4-6 days) but incurs no fees
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Reward Distribution</h2>
      <p>
        Staking rewards are automatically reflected in the increasing value of your LSOL tokens relative to SOL. 
        This means you don't need to claim rewards manually - they are automatically compounded to maximize your returns.
      </p>
